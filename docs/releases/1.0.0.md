# RADAR 1.0.0 Release Notes

Date: 2025-09-28

## Highlights
- Unified YAML configuration for capture, live, assemble, and poster modes with CLI overrides logged for visibility.
- Configurable protocol default filters allowing TN3270 deployments on non-standard ports without code changes.
- Documentation suite overhauled (README, Ops Runbook, Developer Guide, Observability, Upgrade Guide, 3-Node architecture) to reflect YAML-first workflows.

## Upgrade Guidance
1. Copy config/radar-example.yaml and tailor capture, live, assemble, and poster sections for your environment.
2. Launch each CLI with --config=/path/to/radar.yaml; verify WARN logs for any overrides that should be folded back into configuration management.
3. Update automation scripts (including 
adar wrapper commands) to pass the new --config flag and rely on YAML defaults.
4. Replace legacy JAR references (RADAR-0.1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar) with RADAR-1.0.0.jar and ensure resource attributes include service.version=1.0.0.

## Compatibility Notes
- Existing CLI flags continue to operate and now override YAML values with a structured WARN entry.
- protocolDefaultFilter.* keys default to prior behavior (GENERIC=tcp, TN3270=tcp and (port 23 or port 992)) to preserve historical filtering until overridden.

## Known Issues
- None at release time. Report issues with sanitized logs, YAML snippets, and packet captures (where policy permits).
